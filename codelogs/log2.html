        <h3>What is the difference between "Absolute" and "Relative" CSS length units?</h3>
	        
        <ul>
            <li>The difference is that relative units rely on other units to give them a value whereas absolute units are generally considered to always be the same.</li>
            
            <li>The benefit to using relative units instead of a set unit comes when you are attempting to scale something in comparison to another element. Say you want some shape to be exactly scaled to the other one, you can use a relative unit instead of trying to match with an absolute unit.</li>
        </ul>
            
        <h4>What is "px"?</h4>
            <p><span>px</span>or <span>pixel</span>, is an absolute unit of measure that represents roughly 1/96th of 1 inch. It does not mean 1 physical pixel on your screen, it may span mulitple pixels on a large tv screen or a large monitor.</p>

        <h4>What is "pt"?</h4>
            <p>Contrary to popular belief, <span>pt</span> does not stand for physical therapy, no, it stands for <span>point</span>! A<span>point</span>, in CSS lengths, is roughly 1/72nd of 1 inch.</p>
